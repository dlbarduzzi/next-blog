## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight, readable syntax for formatting text. In software engineering,
it's the go-to format for documentation, README files, technical blogs, and even
internal communication. This post will demonstrate every major Markdown feature with
examples relevant to our field.

Mastering **Markdown** is an essential skill for developers looking to create clean and
readable documentation. With its simplicity and flexibility, it allows you to craft
everything from README files to blog posts. If you're just starting, check out
[this comprehensive guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) to learn the basics and take
your skills to the next level!

## Contentlayer

[Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) is a content SDK that validates and
transforms your content into type-safe JSON data that you can easily import into your
application. It makes working with local markdown or MDX files a breeze. This replaces
`MDX-bundler` and our own markdown processing workflow.

## A color scheme for focusing

**Monokai Pro** is a color scheme, user interface theme and icon pack for code editors.
It has been designed with **beautiful functionality** in mind. Carefully selected shades
of color are the foundation of an uncompromising, non-distractive user interface.

```js showLineNumbers title="filename.js" {3..4,9}
export default class MonokaiPro {
  constructor() {
    this.theme = "Monokai Pro Light"
    this.numIcons = 70
  }

  // set color scheme, UI, icon pack
  setTheme(theme) {
    this.theme = theme

    console.log(`theme: ${theme}`)
  }
}
```

AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

- ✨Magic ✨

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that
people naturally use in email. As [John Gruber](https://google.com) writes on the
[Markdown site](https://google.com)

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable
> as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting
> instructions.

This text you see here is \*actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's
syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
