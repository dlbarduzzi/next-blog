Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that
people naturally use in email. As [John Gruber](https://google.com) writes on the
[Markdown site](https://google.com)

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable
> as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting
> instructions.
